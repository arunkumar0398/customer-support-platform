# Multi-Tenant Customer Support Platform

**Status (2026-10-31):** committed base `981697f0dce286116e035c3c3a9d0f6850bfea94` passed exact-head GitHub Actions [run #20](https://github.com/arunkumar0398/customer-support-platform/actions/runs/41084322903). The current uncommitted worktree adds a staff-only active-customer lookup and accessible create picker, plus a conditional required reason field for reopening resolved tickets. `npm run check` passes on the worktree; all 24 Playwright cases passed when run in two fresh-server batches (10/10 + 14/14). Exact-worktree Docker build/start and health/proxy checks also passed using the existing local DB volume. These local changes are not yet in hosted CI or deployed Preview. A35 remains blocked on deployed agent/customer journeys and foreign-object denial; migration rollback, dedicated accessibility audit, and final independent review remain open. Production evidence is separate and was not changed by these checks.

The employer assessment PDF is the product contract in [`reference/assessment.pdf`](reference/assessment.pdf). The approved design, task plan, acceptance matrix, security contract, and assumptions are under `docs/` and `harness/`.

## Current checkpoint

- C0 workspace and local database foundation are in place.
- TK-03–TK-22 design/schema/seed/auth/tenant/policy, membership, ticket, dashboard, health, and readiness APIs have scoped evidence. TK-23–TK-29 deliver sign-in, ticket list/create/detail, dashboard, and admin membership screens with scoped browser evidence. The 2026-10-31 create/reopen UX follow-up adds staff customer selection and reasoned reopen UI; see `evidence/checkpoints/TK-25-2026-10-31.md`.
- `api/src/app.ts` exposes health/readiness, authentication, membership, ticket, activity, comment, and dashboard endpoints documented in [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md). The browser uses a same-origin `/api` proxy in development; authentication stays in the server session cookie.
- A03, A04, A09, A13, A18–A21, and A29 have passed only their recorded API/database scopes. A22/A23 and other complete acceptance IDs remain `NOT_RUN` until their full journeys are tested. `npm run check` runs unit/database tests, lint, typecheck, test discovery, and builds; `npm run test:e2e` executes the browser suite.

## Local database setup

Use Node 24, npm 11, Git, and Docker Desktop with Compose. On PowerShell, copy `.env.example` to `.env` if needed and generate separate 32-byte random values encoded as hex for `POSTGRES_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`, `APP_DB_PASSWORD`, `TEST_DB_PASSWORD`, and `SESSION_SECRET`. Hex values avoid URL-reserved characters in database passwords. Keep `APP_DB_PASSWORD` identical in `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`, and keep `TEST_DB_PASSWORD` identical to the password in `TEST_DATABASE_URL`. Repeated placeholders in the template represent shared values. Do not commit `.env`.

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path .env)) { Copy-Item .env.example .env }
npm ci
docker compose up -d --wait database
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

The seed command verifies a loopback `support_dev` connection before writing. It creates synthetic records only. Database integration tests use the separate disposable `support_test` identity; run `npm run db:migrate:test` and `npm run db:verify-test` to check that target.

## Docker-local app run

For the production-built local API and web containers, follow [`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md). The flow starts the database, runs the guarded host migration and synthetic seed, then builds and launches API and web containers. The frontend is available at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

## Demo accounts

The eight Alpha/Beta synthetic accounts cover admin, agent, and customer roles. Their shared demo password and fixtures are documented in [`docs/demo-accounts.md`](docs/demo-accounts.md). Browser authentication tests create and clean up an isolated fixture in the verified disposable `support_test` database; they do not use the seeded demo accounts or developer database. A25 remains `NOT_RUN` until the documented local setup and seeded-account sign-in journey is verified.

### Vercel Preview test account

This synthetic administrator exists only in the Neon Preview database; the local seed does not create it. Use it only with the Vercel Preview application. Do not reuse it for Production or any real account.

- Email: `preview-admin-20261030-9693f9@example.test`
- Password: `PreviewOnly-E2E-2026-10-30!`

The last recorded Preview check (2026-10-30) used a Ready candidate at `eb4f285`: the synthetic administrator inspected the queue/roster, restored ticket priority and assignment after reversible checks, added a labeled test comment, and verified a stale-version write is rejected. The credential is synthetic and intentional. The 2026-10-31 customer-picker/reopen-reason changes are local and not deployed; agent/customer Preview journeys, those updated UI flows, and true foreign-tenant object denial remain pending. Prior Preview comments/audit events remain in the Preview database; Production was not changed by the local checks.

## Checks

```powershell
npm run check
py -3 scripts/check-doc-contract.py
```

`npm run check` runs lint, typecheck, API and web tests, Playwright test listing, and API/web builds. The listing is discovery only; run `npm run test:e2e` to execute browser journeys against the guarded local test database.

## Deployment

The approved target is Vercel (Vite frontend and Express Node Function) with Neon PostgreSQL. Deployment is a separate checkpoint and requires new explicit approval after the secure Docker-local MVP is complete. See `harness/VERCEL_NEON_DEPLOYMENT.md` for the deployment contract.
