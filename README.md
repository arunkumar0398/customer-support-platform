# Multi-Tenant Customer Support Platform

**Status (2026-10-30):** the MVP application is implemented and deployed to Vercel Preview with Neon Preview data. GitHub Actions run [#19](https://github.com/arunkumar0398/customer-support-platform/actions/runs/41080629706) passed on validated candidate `eb4f2855207b9b743227a52e7e569d9e9a4737d4` (verified checkout SHA and successful `verify` job). The repo includes TypeScript workspaces, PostgreSQL/Prisma schema and migrations, session authentication, membership RBAC, tenant-scoped ticket APIs and React workflows for sign-in, queue, ticket detail/create, dashboard, and admin membership. Release readiness remains blocked on deployed all-role and foreign-object denial proof, complete Preview lifecycle, exact-candidate Docker/migration/accessibility checks, and final independent review. Production is deployed separately; do not treat Preview evidence as Production acceptance.

The employer assessment PDF is the product contract in [`reference/assessment.pdf`](reference/assessment.pdf). The approved design, task plan, acceptance matrix, security contract, and assumptions are under `docs/` and `harness/`.

## Current checkpoint

- C0 workspace and local database foundation are in place.
- TK-03–TK-22 design/schema/seed/auth/tenant/policy, membership, ticket, dashboard, health, and readiness APIs are closed with scoped evidence. TK-23 adds the sign-in flow and authenticated React shell. TK-24 adds the ticket list, search, filters, paging, and UI states; create/detail/dashboard/admin screens remain pending.
- `api/src/app.ts` exposes health/readiness, authentication, membership, ticket, activity, comment, and dashboard endpoints documented in [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md). The browser uses a same-origin `/api` proxy in development; authentication stays in the server session cookie.
- A03, A04, A09, A13, A18–A21, and A29 have passed only their recorded API/database scopes. A22/A23 and other complete acceptance IDs remain `NOT_RUN` until their full journeys are tested. `npm run check` runs unit/database tests, lint, typecheck, test discovery, and builds; `npm run test:e2e` executes the browser suite.

## Local database setup

Use Node 24, npm 11, Git, and Docker Desktop with Compose. On PowerShell, copy `.env.example` to `.env` if needed and generate separate 32-byte random values encoded as hex for `POSTGRES_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`, `APP_DB_PASSWORD`, `TEST_DB_PASSWORD`, and `SESSION_SECRET`. Hex values avoid URL-reserved characters in database passwords. Keep `APP_DB_PASSWORD` identical in `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`, and keep `TEST_DB_PASSWORD` identical to the password in `TEST_DATABASE_URL`. Repeated placeholders in the template represent shared values. Do not commit `.env`.

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path .env)) { Copy-Item .env.example .env }
npm ci
docker compose up -d --wait database
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

The seed command verifies a loopback `support_dev` connection before writing. It creates synthetic records only. Database integration tests use the separate disposable `support_test` identity; run `npm run db:migrate:test` and `npm run db:verify-test` to check that target.

## Docker-local app run

For the production-built local API and web containers, follow [`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md). The flow starts the database, runs the guarded host migration and synthetic seed, then builds and launches API and web containers. The frontend is available at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

## Demo accounts

The eight Alpha/Beta synthetic accounts cover admin, agent, and customer roles. Their shared demo password and fixtures are documented in [`docs/demo-accounts.md`](docs/demo-accounts.md). Browser authentication tests create and clean up an isolated fixture in the verified disposable `support_test` database; they do not use the seeded demo accounts or developer database. A25 remains `NOT_RUN` until the documented local setup and seeded-account sign-in journey is verified.

### Vercel Preview test account

This synthetic administrator exists only in the Neon Preview database; the local seed does not create it. Use it only with the Vercel Preview application. Do not reuse it for Production or any real account.

- Email: `preview-admin-20261030-9693f9@example.test`
- Password: `PreviewOnly-E2E-2026-10-30!`

The Preview origin/CSRF configuration is set for the matching Web/API Preview deployment. The latest validated deployment is Ready at `eb4f285`. The synthetic Preview admin was used to inspect queue/roster, restore ticket priority and assignment after reversible checks, add a labeled test comment, and verify a stale-version write is rejected. The synthetic credential is intentional and is not a release blocker. Agent/customer Preview journeys, create flow, successful reopen (requires a reason field not exposed in UI), and true foreign-tenant object denial remain pending. Preview comments/audit events remain in the Preview database; Production was not changed by these checks.

## Checks

```powershell
npm run check
py -3 scripts/check-doc-contract.py
```

`npm run check` runs lint, typecheck, API and web tests, Playwright test listing, and API/web builds. The listing is discovery only; run `npm run test:e2e` to execute browser journeys against the guarded local test database.

## Deployment

The approved target is Vercel (Vite frontend and Express Node Function) with Neon PostgreSQL. Deployment is a separate checkpoint and requires new explicit approval after the secure Docker-local MVP is complete. See `harness/VERCEL_NEON_DEPLOYMENT.md` for the deployment contract.
